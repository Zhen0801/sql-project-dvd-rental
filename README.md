## Project: Query the DVD Rental database
**SQL** will be used to explore a database related to movie rentals. The purpose of the project is to **run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of the queries**.


## Background
The **Sakila Database** holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, you will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.
